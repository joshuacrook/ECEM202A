# Situational Awareness and Gesture Control for Smart Lights

Project for ECE M202A Embedded Systems.

## Abstract

Smart lights often feature smartphone or voice control, scheduling, and color and brightness selection, but lack any situational awareness capabilities that react to the environment. Additionally, users cannot change these settings without a smartphone or smart speaker, which may not be practical in all situations. The smart light switch proposed here aims to address these issues by increasing automation through situational awareness features such as adaptive brightness and person identification to automatically set lights according to environmental conditions and personal preferences. Additionally, manual control will be possible without other smart devices through advanced gesture control powered by embedded neural networks.
